Title of Project
Employee Summary

Project Description: This project teaches you how to use node.js, switch statements, how to use render, how to link html pages with node.

Installations: Installed npm package, npm i inquirer

Usage: This application is used to create employee info on your webpage.

Steps I took to complete assignment:
1. Created employee, engineer, intern node folders
2. Added necessary constructors for each class
3. created arrays of questions for each type of employee
4. Created a switch statement to pick from type of employee and created a quit option to end creating employees.
5. Created an if/else statement to run through all of the questions for each employee and once run through was complete, the cycle could start over
6. Created a fs.writeFile to get the employee info from the console to the webpage
